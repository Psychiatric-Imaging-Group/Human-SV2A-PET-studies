# Human in-vivo SV2A PET studies

## About this repository:

This repository contains supplementary information for the review **Synaptic changes in psychiatric and neurological disorders: state-of-the art of in vivo imaging**[^1]. Due to the volume of data extracted, only statistically significant findings were included in the tables within the manuscript. Full data is available to access in this repository.
